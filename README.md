# RestClient

A simple iOS app that consumes a RESTFul web service.


In this project, I didnâ€™t use any 3rd party REST libraries like RestKit, nor did I use any dependency manager like Cocoapods or Carthage, which make our life easier. For this small project I have used NS* classes to handle REST API and JSON data. 


## How will you run this project in Xcode

1. Clone the project:

Once I experienced problem to run an Xcode project, after cloning from Github, which had been pushed into Github by git command instead of using Xcode IDE directly. If you encounter the same problem, I think then you need ###RestClient.xcodeproj#### file. Feel feel free to contact at azizur.ice@gmail.com if you need this file to run this project successfully in your machine.
